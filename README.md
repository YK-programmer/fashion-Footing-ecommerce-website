# What I Learn 
While creating this project, I had the opportunity to become familiar with SwiperJS, which helped me create a swiping slide feature. Additionally, I was able to explore new design approaches for navigation bars and make improvements to my CSS code. Through this experience, I was able to gain more knowledge in web development that will be beneficial in future projects.
